<div><p>The checkbox decides if the game should group the scores of different users together based on their
    full name. Useful if you run build from distinct repositories where the same person has different identities.
    Hudson treats each repository user as a distinct build participant, each holding its own score.
    When this happens, it is difficult to follow each person scores.
    </p>
  <p>If this checkbox is enabled, the game will group the scores of the users that share the same full name.
    If this checkbox is disabled, the game will show each user score individually.</p>
  <p>This setting only impact the display of the scores, they are still recorded for each user individually</p>
