<div><p>This parameter allows filtering out inactive user from the leader board. By default scores are shown
    for every user that ever triggered a build on the system. When the team members change a lot over time, the board
    still shows user that have no activities at all on the project.
    </p>
  <p>If this parameter is set to 0, no filtering is applied, otherwise only the users that were part of a build in the specified number of days will be shown</p>
